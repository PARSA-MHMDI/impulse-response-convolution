# Impulse Response Convolution
Project for Amirkabir University in signals and systems course. Convolution of different impulse response signals as means of applying reverberation to the sound of another signal.

## What you will learn by doing this project:

- Create function for computing matrix determinant
- Create function for computing matrix inverse (if possible)
- Plot an audio signal in Matlab
- Plot an impulse signal in Matlab
- Discrete matrix convolution
- Compute Convolution two Impulse Response
- Convert audio to a matrix
- Added Echo to an audio signal at any time 

## Requirements:
- Matlab R2021a
